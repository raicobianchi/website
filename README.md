# Develop locally
On a mac with php installed you can create a local host on port 8080 by writing the following command in your terminal
`php -s localhost:8080`

## PHP on your mac
If you do not have php installed please one of the link provided [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.packages.php) and use the newly installed package manager to install it. **Homebrew** is great üëå

If you have Homebrew installed, just run `brew install php` in your terminal.

That should be enough!
